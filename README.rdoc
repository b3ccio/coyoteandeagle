== Coyote and Eagle
=== This app was one of the projects during the Tribec4H4cks NDN Country Hackathon in Nov 2014 at the IAIA Institute in Sante Fe, New Mexico. 

This repo is dated, but we hope to bring it back and continue building out software that will encourage language preservation.

Some future enhancements including creating tribal profiles, uploading .mp3s, submitting and sharing stories. Thereâ€™s a lot of potential. We hope you would like to fork and contribute.


Technologies used during the Hackathon:

* Ruby on Rails version 4.1

* MySQL Database (Heroku add-ons)

* Twitter Bootstrap 3.2.3

* jquery.ScrollMagic/Tween

* Rails_admin for CMS

* Hosted on Heroku.com
